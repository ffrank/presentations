We all rely on open source software increasingly. With large, popular projects
like Mozilla or Apache, the tools often yield even better results than than
their commercial counterpart. For less generic needs, there is usually still
a more or less wide range of free software available. However, ongoing maintenance
of such programs puts a great strain on their authors. Often enough, a tool
or library will fall into disrepair as the maintainer's life goes on and
priorities shift.

Diverse ecosystems of independent small projects are especially prone for
such partial decay. Examples include CPAN, PEAR, Ruby Gems or the Puppet Forge.
For the latter, the Vox Pupuli group ("voice of the puppet") has set out
to help. We form a collective of volunteers that will pick up the responsibility
for Puppet modules, or other software from the Puppet ecosystem. We care for
dozens of projects by now, with almost as many community members. Still, we
are always looking for more help to take even better care of all the bug
reports and pull requests.

This presentation gives an overview of our work and organization. We advocate
some important core values and principles, so be sure to check us out - we
might just be the group you always wanted to join, without knowing it. You
are most certainly welcome!
