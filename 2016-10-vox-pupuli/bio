Felix is an IT professional from Berlin, Germany. In all of his operations roles,
he has put a focus on automation, but also always tried to be in touch with
the minutiae of software tuning and debugging.

His open source journey was preluded in 2009 with work on the OSD branch of OpenAFS.
Later, he started creating bug fixes and some features for Puppet, one of the leading
server automation tools. Privileged with the ability to make some notable contributions,
Felix has reaped a number of benefits from his participation.  Chief among these is
a network of like-minded peers that culminated in the Vox Pupuli initiative.

Ever since his OpenAFS days, Felix has been critical of the hostile culture in spaces
like the Linux community, and advocates a friendlier, more professional conduct.

When not toiling on his open source projects, he likes riding his bicycle through town,
preparing his own meals or compensating for all the screen time in martial arts classes.
