manifest code
  -> relationships per resource

compiler
  + other input: facts, puppetdb

agent -- GRAPH -- mgmt

individual resources <- puppet magic

complexer graphs -> whits


------------------------------------------

presentation order:
- result: what you can do
- manifest code
- compiler
- agent
- graph (simplified)
- mgmt graph
- classes and whits
- individual resources
- unsupported resources
- puppet magic -> need agent on each mgmt machine
- compiler input: facts, puppetdb -> also pins graph in time
- outlook: what a DSL will bring to the table
