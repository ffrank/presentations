- intro
- title
- seen at devopsdays, docker
- even committed this myself
- funny trenches image -> colorful metaphor
- makes you wonder (mass trauma? delusion? -> less sinister)
- tech is close to pop culture (exhibit A: reaction gifs)
- war is oddly romantisized in pop culture
- war as comics backdrop
- even darker depictions are compelling
- evocative, but what do we describe?
- issue X happened, collegue Y had a break down, customer Z threatened [the Monday]
- we call that war?! [refugees image]
- why even care? we are all adults here after all
- culture is important. inclusivity is hard
- reinforcing our pop culture fixation won't help
- alternatives? horror story is better, but still off the mark
- pretense not actually needed - anecdote? story?
- not important what, just be sensitive. thanks for listening
- p.s. is software/ops = tech same as usa = america ?
