Needed:
- Story
- Software Eng. metaphor(s) for the core concepts (and others?)

Topics:

- Config Management Goals
  * no manual mucking on shells / WebUIs / GUIs
  * repeatability
  * infrastructure as code

- architectural components
  * Puppet: master, manifest, agent, facter, puppetdb, hiera
  * Ansible: playbooks, ssh, inventory

- day-to-day: Puppet

- day-to-day: Ansible

- language differences
  -> module, role, resource/task

- Testing
  * Puppet: noop run, catalog-diff, rspec-puppet, beaker
  * Puppet: check run, infra-test

- Conceptual basis
  * Puppet: Provide way to form single-transaction convergence iteration for each single machine
  * Ansible: Provide arbitrary views and distributed scripts to apply certain aspects of the inventory
