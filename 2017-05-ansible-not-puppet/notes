    * Puppet = hand annotated personalized script to each actor
    * Ansible = One person holds script, directs all actors + mouths lines

Topics:

- Config Management Goals
  * no manual mucking on shells / WebUIs / GUIs
  * repeatability
  * infrastructure as code

- architectural components
  * Puppet: master, manifest, agent, facter, puppetdb, hiera
  * Ansible: playbooks, ssh, inventory

- day-to-day: Puppet
  * manifest code and hiera data control everything
  * code largely from the Forge
  * roles and profiles
  * optionally Foreman or other ENC
  * MCollective
  * PuppetBoard

- day-to-day: Ansible
  * code in roles, data looked up in grouped YAML inventory
  * roles available from galaxy, config is then in structured data
  * playbooks assign roles, handle orchestration
  * controlled from arbitrary machines via SSH
  * little comfort without Tower

- language differences
  -> module, role, resource/task

- Testing
  * Puppet: noop run, catalog-diff, rspec-puppet, beaker
  * Puppet: check run, infra-test

- Conceptual basis
  * Puppet: Provide way to form single-transaction convergence iteration for each single machine
  * Ansible: Provide arbitrary views and distributed scripts to apply certain aspects of the inventory
