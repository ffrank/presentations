- title
- about me
- my mgmt story
- synopsis of basics
- demo time! (do some translation, run mgmt from manifest)

= review of the tech (last year)
- puppet is hard -> example w/ each loop + array
- compiler emits resource catalog
- have auto-require and friends -> agent component
- finally, go resource by resource
- demo time (single file? res example)

= news - new types + semantic feedback
- augeas
- aws
- both way less features than in puppet
 -> demo: remove one ignore rule, show warnings

- semantics: example resource with
  1. cosmetic translation miss
  2. serious translation loss

- all fun and games with single resources
- at scale, problematic
- mini-demo: translate complex module to /dev/null

- reflection: what is this doing anyway?
- where should this be going?

- thanks + come to the hack day
